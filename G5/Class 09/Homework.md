# Objective:
Create a fully styled, responsive webpage using HTML and CSS. The page will consist of multiple sections, including a navigation bar, hero section, content areas with images, and a footer. You will implement Flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.

# Instructions:
Create an HTML file (name it index.html) and a CSS file (name it styles.css).

The webpage should include the following sections:

Header Section: A navigation bar with links (use Flexbox for layout).
Hero Section: A large image with an overlay text (title and short description).
Main Content Section: Multiple content blocks, each with an image and text (use Flexbox for alignment).
Contact Form: A simple contact form with fields for Name, Email, and a Message.
Footer Section: Include social media icons (use FontAwesome or simple text links) and your copyright notice.

CSS Styling:

Use Flexbox to create responsive layouts.
Set up media queries for responsive design (the page should adjust well on small devices like phones).
Add hover effects to navigation links and buttons.
Customize the form inputs for a clean, modern look.
Add background colors, fonts, and spacing to improve the overall design.
